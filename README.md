## Introduction

Connect 4 Bot using Minimax Algorithm is a classic implementation of Connect 4 in Python, featuring a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the pygame library and allows a user to play against an AI opponent powered by the MiniMax Algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Due to the simple nature of Connect 4 and the fact that if both players play a perfect game, the starting player will always win, the bot can definitely by beaten if the player starts first. This game is designed for players to test themselves against a computer opponent and gain a better understanding of the game.
